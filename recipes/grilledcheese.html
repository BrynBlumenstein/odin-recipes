    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here's a classic recipe for a simple and delicious grilled cheese sandwich</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices of bread (white, whole wheat, or your choice)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li> 
        <li>1 to 1 1/2 cups shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, Swiss, or your favorite melting cheese)</li> 
        <li>Optional additions: sliced tomatoes, cooked bacon, or ham</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of softened butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Place two slices of bread, butter-side down, on the hot surface.</li>
        <li>Quickly add your choice of cheese evenly on the slices of bread. If you like, add any optional additions like sliced tomatoes, cooked bacon, or ham.</li>
        <li>Top with the remaining slices of bread, butter-side facing up.</li>
        <li>Cook until the bottom of the sandwich is golden brown and the cheese starts to melt, usually about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip the sandwich with a spatula and cook the other side until it's golden brown and the cheese is completely melted.</li>
        <li>Once both sides are golden and the cheese is melted, remove the sandwich from the heat.</li>
        <li>Let it cool for a minute before slicing it in half diagonally.</li>
    </ol>
