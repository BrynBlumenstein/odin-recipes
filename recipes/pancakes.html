    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here's a simple recipe for delicious pancakes</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>Cooking spray or additional butter for greasing the pan</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, milk, egg, and melted butter.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently stir until just combined. It's okay if there are a few lumps.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly coat with cooking spray or butter.</li>
        <li>Scoop 1/4 cup portions of batter onto the hot griddle. Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancakes and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes on the other side, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
